Download index.html file and play around with Waitlist

As it loads all the tables are occupied, there is a little button to release occupancy from all the tables. 

Another futureproof is that if you do have reservation for more than 2, 4 or 6 people - reservation will be in waitlist until logic finds best seating for people underneath the reservation.
